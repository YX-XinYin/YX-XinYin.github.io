Hi, I'm Xin Yin, a third-year master's student at Zhejiang University. 

My research interests focus on network systems. Specifically, I leverage virtualization technologies to optimize virtual switches in data centers. In addition, I have research experience in the implementation of deep and reinforcement learning algorithms as well as network systems. Therefore, I plan to integrate these areas of knowledge to develop machine learning systems and optimize distributed network architectures for both machine learning inference and training.
