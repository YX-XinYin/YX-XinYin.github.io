<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi, I'm Xin Yin, a third-year master's student at Zhejiang University, under the joint supervision of [Prof. Shibo He](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shibohe) and [Prof. Yuanchao Shu](https://yshu.org/).

My primary research interest is in network systems. Specifically, I leverage virtualization technologies to enhance the performance of virtual switches in data centers. Additionally, I have research experience in developing and applying deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. Therefore, I plan to integrate these areas of expertise to advance machine learning systems and improve the efficiency of distributed network architectures for both model inference and training.

<span style="color:red">I am currently applying for a PhD program. Any position recommendations would be sincerely appreciated.</span>
